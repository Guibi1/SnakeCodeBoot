# SnakeCodeBoot

Our team created a fun and engaging snake game using Python and the CodeBoot framework. The game features classic gameplay mechanics, such as the snake growing longer as it eats food and the game ending if the snake collides with the walls or itself. We also added some new features, such as power-ups that can increase the speed or size of the snake.

Developing this game required some creative problem-solving and optimization, as we had to make the game run smoothly on the limited resources of the microcontroller. We also had to think carefully about the user interface, as the TTGO microcontroller has a small screen and limited input options. We implemented an intuitive control scheme using the onboard buttons and a clear visual style that makes it easy to follow the action.

Overall, we're proud of what we accomplished in the time available for the hackathon. This project challenged us to apply our skills in new ways and work effectively as a team. We hope that players will enjoy our Python snake game on their TTGO microcontrollers and maybe even learn something new about coding and game development in the process.
